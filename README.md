# GitHub Review Dashboard

I you want to see it in action, head to https://grd.dve.al.

## What is this?

This is a dashboard for showing all the pull requests in repositories along with their review information.
Currently it's difficult to know what's changed and what the state of the review is when looking at the GitHub pull
request list view. This dashboard aims to solve that problem by surfacing all PRs with review status, what's changed
since your last review, all so you don't miss any outstanding pull requests.

## How do I use it?

You can either use the hosted version at https://grd.dve.al or you can run it yourself.

Your token and personal data are never transmitted out of your browser, GitHub Review Dashboard runs entirely in your
browser.

### Running it yourself

You can run it yourself by cloning this repository and running `yarn install` and `yarn start` to run the project in
development mode.
